# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing?
    #Ans. In the given program, the for loop is looping i in the range between 1 to 20. 20 is not included. Means 1 to 19. It will execute the block of code which is inside the for loop in the given range.
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
    #Ans. If i will equals to 20 only then the my_function will print "you got it".
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
    #Ans. The value of i is 1 <= i <20
